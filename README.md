Variational autoencoder using a similarity metric learned by a generative adversarial network

A TensorFlow implementation of the approach described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.09300.pdf


Code is modified from the VAE and GAN implementations here: https://github.com/ikostrikov/TensorFlow-VAE-GAN-DRAW
